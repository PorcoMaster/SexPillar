# SexPillar
SexPillar is an advanced, fully parametric endstop, drawing inspiration from Unklicky, Sexbolt, and Unklicky_z. Crafted with meticulous attention to detail in Fusion, the design file encompasses a wide range of possibilities and is annotated with comments to ensure ease of use. Tailored specifically for printers with a metallic plate, it incorporates a robust magnet at its base. This magnetic feature not only ensures stability but also facilitates precise adjustments along the X and Y axes. Moreover, its adaptability shines, as it can accommodate any magnet, screw, wire, and heat insert. Primarily, SexPillar is optimized for use with an auto_Z macro, streamlining the calculation of nozzle offsets and babysteps.
